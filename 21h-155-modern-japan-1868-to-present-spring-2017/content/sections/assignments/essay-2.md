Essay 2: Visualizing Modernity
------------------------------

Choose 1 (one) image from the [MIT Visualizing Cultures](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/21f/21f.027/home/index.html) website and 1 (one) primary text that was assigned in class. Analyze them closely and critically, and discuss how your selected sources highlight a central theme in the Japanese experience of modernity during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The image and text may represent complementary or contrasting perspectives. Make your case by citing specific examples from your selected sources. The arguments you make based on the analysis of your chosen sources should, in turn, be supported and supplemented by references to other primary as well as secondary sources assigned in class, along with references to lecture notes and the recommended Gordon text.
